# Knapsack Problem with Slime Mold and Harris Hawk Optimization
This project aims to find solutions to the knapsack problem using two metaheuristic algorithms: Slime Mold and Harris Hawk Optimization.

## Project Description
Slime Mold and Harris Hawk Optimization are two different approaches inspired by nature and known as metaheuristic algorithms. The knapsack problem, on the other hand, is an optimization problem that aims to select items with the highest value while considering the limited capacity of a knapsack.

This project applies the Slime Mold and Harris Hawk Optimization algorithms to the knapsack problem, optimizing parameters such as knapsack capacity, item values, and weights.
